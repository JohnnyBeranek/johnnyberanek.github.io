                I always loved IT and everything around it. I was building PC's for all my life, for myself for friends etc., sometimes I've got even paid for it. I love PC games, I learned basics of HTML and CSS earlier, so this is more as a recap for me, but for sure I learned a lot of new things and organized my thoughts about developing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm realy looking forward for learning new things as I was told by many friends who works as developers - you have to learn, but it is not so hard and the work is great. I've got even tested by few of them and when I saw that I can finish their senteces I knew that it wont be that hard for me. Challenging but not hard
